/*
1. Create an interface LibraryUser with the following methods declared,
Method Name-
registerAccount
requestBook
2. Create 2 classes “KidUsers” and “AdultUser” which implements the LibraryUser interface.

3.  Both the classes should have two instance variables as specified below.
Instance variables  Data type
age int
bookType String



4. The methods in the KidUser class should perform the following logic.
registerAccount function:
if age < 12, a message displaying “You have successfully registered under a Kids Account” should be displayed in the console.
If(age>12), a message displaying, “Sorry, Age must be less than 12 to register as a kid” should be displayed in the console.

Else, a message displaying, “Oops, you are allowed to take only kids books” should be displayed in the console.
5. The methods in the AdultUser class should perform the following logic.

if age > 12, a message displaying “You have successfully registered under an Adult Account” should be displayed in the console.

Else, a message displaying, “Oops, you are allowed to take only adult Fiction books” should be displayed in the console.
6. Create a class “LibraryInterfaceDemo.java” with a main method which performs the below functions,
